            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
                <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep 
                    from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering
                    as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep.</li>
                <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut 
                    into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li>
                <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. 
                    Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool.</li>
                <li>Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
